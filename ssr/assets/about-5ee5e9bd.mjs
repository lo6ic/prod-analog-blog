<h2>About Christopher</h2>

<p>"Building and designing elegant solutions to everyday problems."  That's it, in the most basic sense.</p>

<p>Welcome!  My name is Christopher Schedler and I go by "Chris".  The above statement encapsulates my purpose for what I do as a Software Engineer.  I built this site to document my digital travels and, hopefully, inspire more people to dive into my line of work.</p>

<p>My number one passion, in Software development, is for the "front-end".  The "front-end" code of a program is what the user sees and interacts with (aka: UI).  Building software/apps that an end user likes to use and is inherintly intuitive has always been my biggest focus.</p>

<p>During the day, I code for a company in downtown Kansas City.  I've been developing software for them since 2012 using technologies that include JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, and Java.  The team I work with fixes most of the bugs that show up in our application.  I've learned so much about full-stack development and maintenance.  I love what I do.</p>

<h2>Personal Interests</h2>

<p>In my free time (aka: not engineering software to the best of my ability), I like to:
<ul>
<li>Compete in endurance sports
  <ul>
  <li>In high school, I competed in Cross Country.</li>
  <li>Present day, I compete against myself in swimming, biking, and running events. :-)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Game it up
<ul>
  <li>In general, I've always enjoyed games.  A few students and I started our high school's first chess squad (circa 2002).  We won State that year!</li>
  <li>I've dabbled in card games including Cribbage, Gin Rummy, and all types of Poker games.</li>
  <li>When it comes to digital games, I enjoy the first person shooter genre and strategic games like StarCraft, Clash of Clans, and Clash Royale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Watch sports
  <ul>
  <li>I'm a huge soccer fan.  Sporting Kansas City is my Major League Soccer team.  I started following the English Premier League around 2020 and I'm a big Manchester City fan.  </li>
  <li>I've always enjoyed the NFL and, yup you guessed it, the Kansas City Chiefs are my team.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
