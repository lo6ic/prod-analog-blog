My name is Christopher Schedler and I go by \"Chris\".  The above statement encapsulates my purpose for what I do as a Software Engineer.  I built this site to document my digital travels and, hopefully, inspire more people to dive into my line of work.</p>\n\n<p>My number one passion, in Software development, is for the \"front-end\".  The \"front-end\" code of a program is what the user sees and interacts with (aka: UI).  Building software/apps that an end user likes to use and is inherintly intuitive has always been my biggest focus.</p>\n\n<p>During the day, I code for a company in downtown Kansas City.  I've been developing software for them since 2012 using technologies that include JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, and Java.  The team I work with fixes most of the bugs that show up in our application.  I've learned so much about full-stack development and maintenance.  I love what I do.</p>\n\n<h2>Personal Interests</h2>\n\n<p>In my free time (aka: not engineering software to the best of my ability), I like to:\n<ul>\n<li>Compete in endurance sports\n  <ul>\n  <li>In high school, I competed in Cross Country.</li>\n  <li>Present day, I compete against myself in swimming, biking, and running events. :-)</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li>Game it up\n<ul>\n  <li>In general, I've always enjoyed games.  A few students and I started our high school's first chess squad (circa 2002).  We won State that year!</li>\n  <li>I've dabbled in card games including Cribbage, Gin Rummy, and all types of Poker games.</li>\n  <li>When it comes to digital games, I enjoy the first person shooter genre and strategic games like StarCraft, Clash of Clans, and Clash Royale.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Watch sports\n  <ul>\n  <li>I'm a huge soccer fan.  Sporting Kansas City is my Major League Soccer team.  I started following the English Premier League around 2020 and I'm a big Manchester City fan.  </li>\n  <li>I've always enjoyed the NFL and, yup you guessed it, the Kansas City Chiefs are my team.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li>Read\n<ul><li>My go-to book categories include Science Fiction, Fantasy, Self-help Nonfiction and Autobiographies.</li></ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n</div>\n`;export{e as default};\n";
